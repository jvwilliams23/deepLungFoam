# deepLungFoam

Here, we have implemented a repository for coupling a 3D respiratory CFD model to a lumped-parameter model for downstream flow. This model accounts for pleural-pressure change with time and varying capacitance and resistance across the lungs during the period of respiration. Such models are widely used in literature, so there are many variations. Here we use the model from Oakes et al. [1].
